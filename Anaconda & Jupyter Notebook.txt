Jupyter notebook(.ipynb): www.jupyter.org(Open source interactive datascience & scientific computhing platform)

1. Secure notebook using following command and share the key with only to whom you want: ~/.jupyter/profile-default/security/notebook-secret
2. code mirror can be used to confirgure the parameter for jupyter notebook(Check and learn).

Notes:
1. cmd: activate root(it will connect cmd to conda propt).
1. Start the jupyter notebook(Go to path where you want to start the notebook): 	Command:jupyter notebook
2. There are two types of mode a code cell can be in(Edit mode(Green)-> we can edit and type the python code or Command mode(Blue)-> we can use button by which it will process command linked to that button Ex: A-> To append a cell below).
& From edit mode when we click on ESC button it will change the mode to command mode & Use ENTERE key for vice-versa

3. PIP is python package manager and Conda is 
4. Tab can be use to get list of avaialabl method & attribute.
4. Shift + Tab use to get the details about the method & atribute.
5. Run the code shell
	CTRL+ENTER->Only run the cell 
	SHIFT+ENTER->Run the cell and move to next shell
	ALT+ENTER->Run the cell and enter a blank cell next to it.
6. we can see the order of execution of cells prior to it in square bracket.(Some times we can see astrik(*) in square bracket that means that cell is still executing)
7. to write a file from jupyter itself use %%writefile myfile.txt and below this command type text that file would contain 

Jupyter Magical command:
Types:
	1. Line magic command: It applies the command to one line of the Jupyter cell as its name suggests.
		
	2. Cell magic command: It applies the command to the whole cell of the notebook and needs to be kept at the beginning of the cell.
Commad:
	1. %lsmagic#This will list the all available magical command with notebook.
1. To print the graph within the jupyter notebook we should write "%matplotlib inline" before pritning any graph.

3. To execute the cmd command in jupyter type the command followed by exclamation mark(!)  ex: ! conda install pydot





Anaconda virtual environments: we can have multiple configurations of python installed in our system using virtual environment
1. virtualenv library: For creating virtual environment in normal python distribution.

Commands:
1. conda create --name name_of_enviroment [python=version] [library_name]#If we don't specify the pthon version it will start with base version of python
2. activate name_of_enviroment #Change the base environment to given name environment
3. deactivate#deactivte the environment
4. conda env create -f hello-spark.yml	
	and hello-spark.yml contain the dependencies we want to download
name: hello-spark 
    dependencies:
    
    - python=3.6
    - jupyter
    - ipython
    - numpy
    - numpy-base
    - pandas
    - py4j
    - pyspark
    - pytz
